    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In \textcite[6]{khrapov2016affine}, you have a formula for $k_t^2$. However, and you have $\psi^2 =
            k_t^2 \phi^2$. However, $\psi$ is constant, and so $k_t$ must be as well. If you fill in the formula
            for $k_t$ it is a function of $\sigma^2_t$. Why does this not imply that $\psi$ is not a constant
            function? In other words, the change-of-measure is not structure preserving?
        \item Has anyone discussed the relationship between the variance risk premium and the volatility price? It
            seems like they should be related. If they are, it's probably a good idea to cite them.
